            <p>People have always wondered what makes a movie popular and increase Gross Earnings? Is it the user reviews? Is it the Genre? Is it the Director? I have made a data visuzlization that will show comparison of what makes a movie popular and increase Gross Earnings. I will be using a database that has all the movies Titles, Earnings, directors, Actors, IMDB scores, as well as Genre.   </p>
