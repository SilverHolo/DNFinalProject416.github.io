            <ul>
                <li>Usually people assume that the good user scores from Meta scores means that the movie will make money but that doesn't appear to be true</li>
                <li>We can see some of the higher scores lead to high earnings but we also see some lower scores with higher earnings</li>
                <li>We also see a cluster of movies around the 70-90% meta score of movies that did well earnings wise so higher scores don't instantly mean more as those clusters are in the lower percentages</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This doesn't prove that a high user rating instantly equals higher earnings</p>
